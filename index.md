# Minute-by-Minute 2:30 - 4:30 (120 mins)
*Wednesday will have an additional 10 minutes for added flexibility*

## Distribute Materials - (2:30 - 2:45) (15 mins)
 - Have everyone **find a seat** with their partner
 - Distribute the **Lego kits**
 - Distribute **Laptops**, 1 per group
 - Make sure everyone has the pieces they need to **successfully complete** that day's project
## Warmup - (2:45 - 3:00) (15 mins)
 - Have everyone navigate to the [Lego Spike Editor](https://spike.legoeducation.com/essential/project)
 - Open kits and **organize / play** with Lego pieces
	 - *^ I feel as though this would be a good way to get the Juniors to engage and be excited about the content, Seniors might be easier to get started with. Although I'd like to hear what other Senseis have for warmup ideas.*

## Begin Project - (3:00 - 4:15) (1hr 15mins)
 - **Present** the slide-show on the Lego website providing backstory for the project
 - Navigate to the **instructional** part of the slideshow, go slide by slide making sure the whole class is caught up before moving onto the next one
	 - *Seniors may be able to access the instructions on their own and work independently depending on their comfort level.*
 - If everyone in the class has **completed building** the project, move onto the coding portion of the project. Provide the requirements and have them design their own programs to complete the task.
	 - *Juniors should use the **icon based** coding. Seniors should use the **word based** coding.*
 - Aim to complete the project during this block, if not, record it so it can be completed via an *open day* during the next session.

## Finish Up - (4:15 - 4:30) (15mins)
 - Have everyone find a stopping point and save their progress
 - **Record which computer they used to save their project**
 - Have everyone put the Legos away in an organized way
	 - *Somehow find a way to store their Lego builds so that they can finish next class*
 - If they finished have them disassemble their builds and put them back in the kit neatly

### Be outside by 4:30, depending on the group the Senseis may have to start wrapping up earlier

****
# Filler Activities

If students need a break or are ahead of schedule, Senseis may need to introduce a filler activity, historically these have been activities like:
 - Thisissand
 - Scratch Explore
 - Free Choice on computers
To keep students, especially Juniors, focused on the content, filler activities should be adjacent to the content being covered.
 - Free build with Legos (while keeping talking at a reasonable volume)
 - Free code with Motors and Sensors
 - Scratch
 - other ideas???...
 ****


# Open Days

Built into the schedule are *Open Days* that exist to add flexibility to the curriculum schedule and ensure that most or all of the intended content for the semester is covered. Open days should be used when the students are falling behind and need an extra day to complete a project or used for special days where the students participate in something outside of the curriculum. The protocol for using Open days should be as follows - 
 - When Senseis decide to use an open day they should go to the curriculum page and find the next unused open day.
 - In the far right portion of the table, fill in what the open day is being used for such as "Finishing up Amazing Amusement, Day 4" as well as the date. 
 - At the very top of the curriculum, change the number of open days stated.
# Reviews / Final Projects

At the end of each unit there is a built in **Challenge Day** that encourages students to design and build their own project that fits within the theme of the unit. This functions as a review of concepts covered during the unit and a final project that students get to show off and witness the progress they've made. 

Senseis should assist students with this portion of the unit and encourage / aid with the implementation of creative ideas. 

There is always an *Open Day* built into the schedule following a **Challenge Day**. If it was not used to catch up during the unit, it can either be used to finish up final projects or saved in the case that Senseis fall behind on a future unit.

# Special Days

In addition to using *Open Days* for catching up and finishing up projects, there should ideally be one or two reserved for "special days" like ice cream parties or other events to show appreciation for the students' hard work and reward them for how much they've learned during the semester!
